# An ORM-Based API for E-Commerce

This back-end application provides a RESTful API for an e-commerce site. It utilizes an object-relational mapping (ORM) approach with Express.js and Sequelize to interact with a mysql database.

The ORM enables CRUD operations on product, category, and tag models through a simplified object interface. Express handles routing and requests while Sequelize manages the association between these database entities.
